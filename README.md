# Learning project - Borderless Tourist

## Description
It is a small app that lets you know which attractions are in the city you are in. It is hardcoded. Meaning there are a handful of cities and attractions. It's fun to play around nevertheless! 😉

## How to use
You can add destinations to the destinations list and add attractions by calling the add_attraction function like so:

*add_attraction("Los Angeles, USA", ["Venice Beach", ["beach"]])*

but with your destination and attraction (if you are using a destination that is not on the list of destinations yet, remember to add it first).

Well and then you can use it with a print statement and save it to a variable with a name of your choosing!

Like so for example:

*my_traveler = get_attractions_for_traveler(["John Doe", "São Paulo, Brazil", ["historical site"]])*

## Conclusion
Thank you Codecademy for this lovely exercise I had a blast coding this! 🙏🏻
